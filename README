NAME
    Acme::POE::Acronym::Generator - Generate random POE acronyms.

VERSION
    version 1.20

SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use warnings;
      use Acme::POE::Acronym::Generator;

      my $poegen = Acme::POE::Acronym::Generator->new();

      for ( 1 .. 10 ) {
        my $acronym = $poegen->generate();
        print $acronym, "\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    What does POE stand for?" is a common question, and people have expanded
    the acronym in several ways.

    Acme::POE::Acronym::Generator produces randomly generated expansions of
    the POE acronym ( or at your option any other arbitary word ).

CONSTRUCTOR
    "new"
        Takes three optional parameters:

          'dict', the path to the words file to use, default is /usr/share/dict/words;
          'wordlist', an arrayref consisting of words to use, this overrides the use of dict file;
          'key', provide a word to make an acronym for instead of POE;

        If the dict file doesn't exist it will use a very small subset of
        words to generate responses.

        Returns a shiny Acme::POE::Acronym::Generator object.

METHODS
    "generate"
        Takes no parameters.

        In a scalar context, returns a string containing the acronym.

        In a list context, returns the individual words of the acronym as a
        list.
